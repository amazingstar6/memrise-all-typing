# Memrise All Typing

This userscript prevents multiple choice from occuring in typing courses on Memrise and Decks by Memrise, replacing it with a typing prompt.

### Installation

The easiest method is through the Tampermonkey [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) / [firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/).

Then add the script using the following link: https://github.com/cooljingle/memrise-all-typing/raw/master/Memrise_All_Typing.user.js

After installing you can alter under which circumstances multiple choice gets replaced; instructions are in the script.
